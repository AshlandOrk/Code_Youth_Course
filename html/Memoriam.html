    <h2><u>Intro</u></h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Joe Hill (1879 - 1915) was a Sweedish-American labour activist,
      songwritier, and member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW,
      familairly called the "Wobblies"). He wrote some of their most famous
      surviving labour songs as is famous for being executed by the police in
      Utah after being framed for a murder he did not commit.

    <h2><u>Early History</u></h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Born <b>Joel Emmanuel H채gglund</b> on October 7, 1879 in the town of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle">G채vle</a> G채vle,
      Sweden. Hill was born as the third child in a family of nine, his father
      worked as a conductor on the Gefle-Dala railway line. His early life was
      filled with difficulty as his father died at the age of 41 in 1887 just
      managing to keep the household together until she too died when Hill was
      in his early 20s. Hill immigrated to the United States in October 1902
      with his brother, Paul Alias H채gglund (1877 - 1955). Hill became an
      itinerant labourer and moved around the American East coast before
      traveling to the West.

    <h2><u>IWW</u></h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      By this time using the name Joe or Joseph Hillstrom (possibly because of
      anti-union blacklisting), he joined the Industrial Workers of the World
      (IWW) or Wobblies around 1910, when working on the docks in San Pedro,
      California. In late 1910 he wrote a letter to the IWW newspaper Industrial
      Worker, identifying himself as a member of the IWW local chapter in
      Portland, Oregon. He rose in the IWW organization and traveled widely,
      organizing workers under the IWW banner, writing political songs and
      satirical poems, and making speeches. Joe Hill and Harry McClintock were
      Spellbinders for the IWW and would show up as they did at the Tucker Utah
      strike on June 14, 1913 (Salt Lake Tribune). He shortened his pseudonym to
      "Joe Hill" as the pen-name under which his songs, cartoons and other
      writings appeared. His songs frequently appropriated familiar melodies
      from popular songs and hymns of the time. He coined the phrase "pie in the
      sky", which appeared in his song "The Preacher and the Slave" (a parody of
      the hymn "In the Sweet By-and-By").

    <h2><u>Final Will</u></h2>
    <p>
Before he was executed by firing squad in November, 1915, Hill was able to deliver his final will to Bill Haywood. His will took the form of a poem:
<br>
<br>
<h6>My will is easy to decide</h6> 
<br>
<h6>For there is nothing to divide</h6>
<br>
<h6>My kin don't need to fuss and moan</h6>
<br>
<h6>Moss does not cling to a rolling stone</h6>
<br>
<h6>My body - oh! if I could choose</h6>
<br>
<h6>I would to ashes it reduce</h6>
<br>
<h6>And let the merry breezes blow</h6>
<br>
<h6>To where some fading flowers grow</h6>
<br>
<h6>Perhaps some fading flower then</h6>
<br>
<h6>Would come to life, and bloom again</h6>
<br>
<h6>This is my last and final will</h6>
<br>
<h6>Good luck to you all, Joe Hill</h6>
