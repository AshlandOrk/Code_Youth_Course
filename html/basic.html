<h1> Mycology </h1>
<br />

<h2>Definition </h2>
<p>The term mycology refers to branch of biology that focuses on the kingdom of fungi, which includes macrofungi (mushrooms) as well as microfungi (yeasts and other simple fungi). It is important to note that, despite common misconceptions, fungi are not plants and in fact have more features in common with animals. </h2>
